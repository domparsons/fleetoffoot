			<h2>Latest Cup Report</h2>
			<p>Our 70 + squad bowed out in round 2 of the national cup going down 1 - 2 in a closely contested game against a powerful AFC Bournemouth side. Fleet took the lead from an angled shot by John Brumwell and it took a powerful late effort from distance to eventually beat us.</p>
			<p>Squad members were Adrian Bunting, Alan Bortnik,  Martin Osborn, Pat Lenehan, Robin Howard, John Brumwell, Alan Vickery.</p>

			<h2>Cup Capers 2024</h2>

			<p>In the last of our national cup round 1 games. the 65+ squad went over to Guildford to play Godalming. The captain's (Nick) report follows:</p>
			<p>Well, we lost!  4-1.</p>
			<p>But that doesn’t tell the whole story.</p>
			<p>They scored early to go one up, which was the score at half-time. We set up to be difficult to beat and the game only stretched when in the second half they got their second. Jim Mellish their England player got a second-half hat-trick and Paul for us pulled one back near the end. The good news was no sin bins nor sendings off.  The referee did well and the game was played in a good spirit.</p>
			<p>The facilities at Surrey University were excellent with the coffee shop having a Veranda overlooking the game.</p>
			<p>Afterwards, Godalming played Australia who were a couple of players short so we were invited to play for them but we were a tad tired and besides it was Australia! But that says something about Godalming as a club.  Godalming had played together many times which you could tell.  Pass and move and in the latter stages in control of the game.  They knew what they were doing. That said, we gave a good account of ourselves.</p>
			<div class="article-image-container">
				<img src="images/cup-capers-3.jpg" alt="" height="100%" width="100%" class="header-image image mar20">
			</div>
			
			<p>Jim Hill, Alan Bortnik, Dave Pomfret, Juergen Halten, Rod Bowyer, Mark Ivey, Paul Budd, Nick Andrews.</p>


			
			<p>The 70+ squad got off to a winning start in this year's competition, defeating Rivermead in Reading by 3 goals to 2. Squad was (left to right) Alan Vickery, Martin Osborn, Pat Lenehan, John Brumwell,  Robin Howard, Adrian Bunting. Goals from Alan, Robin and John.</p>
			<p>A crowd of some 20 was in attendance, including our own Will, Dave and Lynn, and Pete who provided the photo.</p>
			<p>65+ and 60+ playing soon.</p>

			<p>Our 60+ squad would have beaten Cove last Friday had it not been for some outstanding goalkeeping by one time member Paul Samways.	</p>
			<p>Paul defied ten efforts on his goal whilst Cove scored from their only two attempts, both 'worldies'.</p>
			<p>All in all, a fine effort from Fleet boding well for the future.</p>
			<p>Squad members were</p>
			<p>Chris Haynes, Dave Moss, Rod Bowyer, Derek Bonnar, Mark Ivey, Martin Clarke, Paul Budd and Nick Andrews.</p>

			<h2 class="textBottomBargin">Annual Review 2022</h2>
			<p class="textBottomBargin">Hi All Members,</p>
			<p class="textBottomBargin">Its that time when we take a quick look back on the previous 12 months activities and try to assess how they might impact on the Club going forward.</p>
			<p>Probably the biggest change has been in the growth of the Ladies' section due, in no small part, I'm led to believe, to the success of England's Lionesses.  One result of their expansion has been that the use of a single cage is no longer sufficient and, with evening take up at the Centre being immensely competitive, the Ladies have resorted to adding an additional session on a portion of the main pitch from 8 to 9 on a Monday evening, This will take effect from early 2023.</p>
			<p>Additionally, and starting Spring time, the Ladies will be entering a team in the Thames Valley league which takes place at Bisham Abbey.</p>
			<p>The Club is contributing half the cost of a new set of kit for all lady members.</p>
			<p class="textBottomBargin">Mainly through the efforts of Sue Scarlett, a highly successful tournament was held in October and was attended by 10 leading teams from the South East.</p>
			<p>The men had an enjoyable friendly down at Romsey, taking teams at 60+ and 70+ level.</p>
			<p>The men's 70+ league team continues to just about maintain a presence in the bi-monthly South East league held in Bournemouth. We sit near the bottom of the league, our points tally not being helped by failing to produce a squad on one occasion. Interest in joining the league is growing and it may well have 2 divisions next season.</p>
			<p class="textBottomBargin">A 60+ squad also participated in a tournament in Havant.</p>
			<p>Club finances remain in good shape with the bank balance at the end of the year standing in excess of £2500.  Any member wishing to have further insight into the Club's finances, should approach Adrian Bunting (Treasurer).</p>
			<p class="textBottomBargin">Since the onset of covid and its adverse impact on small businesses, we have been without any direct support from sponsors and incoming funds are entirely from membership and session fees. We are, however, able to maintain new memberships and renewals for 2023 at pre existing levels of £10 and £5. The system of payment monthly in arrears into the Club account would appear to be working successfully.</p>
			<p class="textBottomBargin">Indirect sponsorship continues to be provided by the Exchequer to whom we are extremely grateful and new discount cards are now available.</p>
			<p class="textBottomBargin">Best Wishes to All for 2023.</p>
			<p>Robin.</p>

			<h2>Romsey Away Day Report (October 2022)</h2>
			<p>The away day friendly in Romsey proved to be an enjoyable day out, starting off with a birthday presentation to Adrian on the eve of a significant age achievement.</p>
			<p>We took 2 squads, 60+ and 70+, playing both our opponents in 7 aside format on grass.</p>
			<p>The 60+ team had a good day beating their age equivalents 4-0 and Romsey's 70+ 5-0.</p>
			<p>On target were Big Clive (5), Graham S (2), Paul 10/10 (1) and Mark (1).</p>
			<p>Our 70+ team could not emulate their youthful comrades, going down 0-1 and 0-2 but, nevertheless, putting in highly creditable performances.</p>
			<p>Squads were:</p>

			<h2>Competitive Walking Football.</h2>
			<p>70+</p>
			<p>The men's section made a return to competition last week, travelling to Bournemouth for the recently started WFA southern 70+ league. 
			Still in its infancy, the league currently comprises Bournemouth, Eastleigh, Cove, Portsmouth and Exeter(!). We were aiming to join later in the year but stepped in to replace Portsmouth who had withdrawn.
			Matches were 7 aside and 20 minutes straight through. With only 7 in our squad (including 2 from Bournemouth) we had to work hard but came away with a creditable set of results losing 1-0 to Bournemouth and Exeter, drawing 0-0 with Cove and beating Eastleigh 2-0. 
			We currently sit NOT bottom of the league, having missed out on the previous event.
			The squad comprised Adrian, Alan, Brian, Graham and myself plus two loanees from the home club.
			Going forward we are in dire need of a goalkeeper (we can use someone 65+ in this comp) so, if you know anyone, please give them a nudge.</p>
			<h2>Youth Section</h2>
			<p>My assessment of the current batch of younger players is that we should be in a position to operate a 60+ (or similar) team. The most likely place to do this is within the Hants FA league run from Southampton. This, however, continues to be run as a 50+ competition despite ourselves and other clubs saying this is dangerous and asking for an older age grouping. Following some ad hoc discussions at Bournemouth, it was decided to renew attempts to get Hants FA to see sense.</p>
			<h2>Steering Group</h2>
			<p>We have some changes here with Martin (membership) and Neil (social) relinquishing their positions. Many thanks to both of them for all the good work they put in. Dave Pomfret has agreed to run the memberships, welcome to him, and we remain searching for someone to take over the social events. All applications gratefully received.</p>
			<h2>Membership</h2>
			<p>We will very soon be in a position to review the composition of the membership so a reminder that, apart from those new members who joined in the last quarter of 2021, you should have remitted your £5 annual renewal. </p>
			<p>Best Regards and Happy Walking Football,</p>
			<p>Robin.</p>

			<p>(The following article by Ken appears in the Fleet News)</p>
			<br>
			<p>"They are two of a kind at Fleet of Foot - and celebrating promotion to a higher level of walking football.</p>
			<p>Step forward Sue Scarlett and Elaine Tookey, who have both been selected for the South East region’s over 50s women’s squad after successful trials.</p>
			<p>The pair’s marvellous achievement is another proud moment for Fleet of Foot  and the supportive staff at Hart Leisure Centre where the club is based.</p>
			<p>The pair’s colleague Adrian Bunting set the benchmark by becoming a member of the first England over 75s squad.</p>
			<p>Adrian, who stepped up to the South Region himself, is not surprised to see Sue and Elaine make it a remarkable treble for Fleet of  Foot.</p>
			<p>He said: “I had always believed that both players had the skill sets to progress beyond domestic club football."</p>
			<p>Elaine is at her best playing wide right or left, has a good first touch and high energy levels.</p>
			<p>Sue prefers to play as a central player, midfield or striker, and possesses a powerful shot with both feet, and is very fit.</p>
			<p>A season of inter-region tournament football with the regular travel that comes with such commitment, will decide whether either or both want to progress to England trials.</p>
			<p>Sue and Elaine are unanimous in stating it is “a dream come true” to be selected.</p>
			<p>Sue, a swimming teacher and cafe assistant at the leisure centre,  said: “ The moment I read the news from the WFA (Walking Football Association) SE England manager I was elated.</p>
			<p>“It is a  very proud moment for me to have been selected. I read the message three times for it to sink in. I realised then what an incredible and privileged opportunity for me to play at this level at my age. A dream come true.”</p>
			<p>Elaine said: "When I went to senior school I was told that I wasn't allowed to play football because I was a girl,</p>
			<p>So nearly 50 years later to be selected to play for the England SE region squad is a dream come true.</p>
			<p>Playing twice a week for Fleet of Foot has been an inspiration. Walking football is a great game to play and I have met some amazing people.”</p>
